## Description
Mr. Potato Head is a simple app that allows you to build the Potato Head of your dreams. It is mainly an exercise in persistence, making sure that the parts you've chosen remain chosen even if the app is closed or the phone is rotated.

## Building
Clone the repository or download the zip file if you're on Windows, and you should be able to open the project root folder as a project in
Android Studio.

## Operation
Tap the checkboxes to change the Potato Dude. It's not rocket science, really...
