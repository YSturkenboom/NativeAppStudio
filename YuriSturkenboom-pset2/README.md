Requires Android Studio to build!
Not tested on screen sizes 'large' and above; proceed at your own peril.

## Description
Are you bored and do you need a story to spice up your life? Is there no one to read you a bed time story? For these unlikely reasons and 
more, you can use MadLibz! Pick some funny words and make a great story!

This app serves to demonstrate the use of multiple activities, and passing values from one to another. The app uses three activities: the
main/input screen, the 'thinking' screen (it secretly does nothing, don't tell anyone) and the result screen.

This time around a bit more design went into the app, and it is designed to provide a good UI Flow and confortable user experience.

## Building
Clone the repository or download the zip file if you're on Windows, and you should be able to open the project root folder as a project in
Android Studio. From there you can build with Gradle in Android Studio and run.

## Operation
Detailed instructions also available in-app: click on the 'i' button for information.

To get started making your stories, just enter the required amount of words and press the "Go!" button.
After a bit of 'thinking', your story will show up as front page news!
