Requires Android Studio to build!
Not tested for Android Wear.

## Description
Eliminate all social interaction by using this app to order your food! 

This app is an exercise in using JSON to retrieve data from an API, and a bit of UI design.
The UI is constructed such that easy intuitive back navigation is always easy.

## Building
Clone the repository or download the zip file if you're on Windows, and you should be able to open the project root folder as a project in
Android Studio. From there you can build with Gradle in Android Studio and run.

## Operation

## Notes
Again: should probably use Fragments, but that is taught in a later assignment. Really hacky use of buttons to make 'tabs', but, it works :)
and I haven't noticed any problems with them. On a more serious note, lots of repeated code for JSON handling is pretty bad. It occurred to
me later that I should have made a seperate class to handle JSON, but I did not (yet) implement it. I may still do so if I have time left 
after the final assignment.
