Requires Android Studio to build!
Not tested for Android Wear.

## Description
A very simple todo app, using databases!

This app has only one Activity and is an exercise in using SQLite databases.

## Building
Clone the repository or download the zip file if you're on Windows, and you should be able to open the project root folder as a project in
Android Studio. From there you can build with Gradle in Android Studio and run.

## Operation
To add a new task, type your task description in the text field and press "Add task". To mark a task as done, click anywhere on the
corresponding task. To delete a task, long-press the corresponding task

## Notes
It's quite easy to remove a task by accident now, because there is no verification of the deletion. A good addition would be a confirmation dialog.
